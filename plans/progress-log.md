# Progress log: search embeddings

All steps done, uncommitted. `just check` green; verified with the compiled binary (`semantic: true`; model cache removed gives `semantic: false` with the dim hint).

- Locked TUNING (`rrfK 20, keywordWeight 1, vectorWeight 1, minSimilarity 0.4`); chunk bonus removed; 256 dims kept. Results table in the plan.
- Open: Brendan to review `eval/queries.json` expected keys (weak: BACK-5874, "appointments not getting cancelled", BACK-4838). `just install` not run.

Suggested commits, in order:
1. `build(cli): bundle onnxruntime in compiled binary` (build.ts, justfile, package.json, bun.lock)
2. `feat(search): relax keyword matching to OR`
3. `feat(search): embed in-process with EmbeddingGemma` (lib/embeddings.ts, lib/index.ts)
4. `feat(search): store and sync per-chunk embeddings` (cache.ts, embed-sync.ts, main.ts embed)
5. `feat(search): tune hybrid ranking and report semantic state` (hybrid-search.ts, main.ts search)
6. `docs(search): document EmbeddingGemma embeddings`
